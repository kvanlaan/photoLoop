# photoLoop
My 2nd program for Introduction to Data Structures at the University of Wisconsin. The program creates a console-based editor that allows a user to create, edit, save, and load a sequence of images (including the title of an image and length of time to display it). The control file the editor creates can then be uploaded and shown in a continuous loop. Java.


See inlist.txt for sample input format.
Works best if opened in Eclipse.
